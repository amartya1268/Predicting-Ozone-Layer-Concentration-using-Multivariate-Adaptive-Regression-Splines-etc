# Predicting-Ozone-Layer-Concentration-using-Multivariate-Adaptive-Regression-Splines-etc

This project proposes a method for predicting ozone concentration using three regression models. The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines model outperforms the Random Forest and Classification And Regression Tree in terms of accuracy and dataset description. It considers less variables and evaluates on 8 variables, compared to the other two. The elapsed time for building the tree is 45 seconds. The most important variable is PT08_S2_NMHC_, while PT08_S1_CO_ is the most important variable in the Random Forest and Classification And Regression Tree. The model provides the closest curve to both the train and test sets, making it a valuable tool for future ozone predictions.
